# Captcha Solver Frontend ApplicationThis is a simple, single-file responsive HTML application designed to act as a frontend for a human-assisted captcha solver. It displays a captcha image and provides an input field for the user to type the characters they see.## Features- **Dynamic Image Loading**: Displays a captcha image. By default, it uses `sample.png`.- **URL Parameter Support**: Can load an image from a URL provided as a query parameter (e.g., `index.html?url=https://example.com/captcha.png`).- **User Input**: An input field for users to enter the captcha solution.- **Basic Verification (for default image)**: Includes a simple client-side check for the default `sample.png` (expects "ADURS"). For external URLs, it indicates that a backend is needed for verification.- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a modern, mobile-friendly interface.## How to Run1.  Save the `index.html` file and `sample.png` in the same directory.2.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.3.  To test with a custom image, append `?url=YOUR_IMAGE_URL` to the URL in your browser's address bar (e.g., `file:///path/to/index.html?url=https://example.com/another-captcha.png`).## Technologies Used- HTML5- Tailwind CSS (via CDN)- JavaScript (Vanilla ES6+)## LicenseThis project is open-sourced under the MIT License.
